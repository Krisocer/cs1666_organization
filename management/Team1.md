2. 10/12 - 10/18
	* Manager: James Baker
	* Goals:
		1. First main room (1920 x 1080, 1.5 times the size of the screen to ensure scrolling working in all directions).

		3. Implement attacking and allow player/enemies to be killed
		4. Create timer that ends game if it reaches 0
		5. Create a basic item shop without items - blank grid that is available when player enters a shop
